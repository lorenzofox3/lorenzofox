<p>Hi, my name is Laurent. I am a software developer with more than ten years of experience, mostly in web technologies, but not only.</p>

<p>I enjoy the web platform a lot but also in areas such as Postgres, maps and data science.</p>

<p>I have been writing for a while on different platforms like <a href="https://lorenzofox3.medium.com/">Medium</a> or <a href="https://dev.to/lorenzofox3">Dev.to</a> to finally create this blog.</p>

<p>You can hire me or find out more about my professional background on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurent-renard-a39b5357">linkedin</a>.</p>

<p>I hope you will enjoy your reading !</p>
